Formally is a lightweight and unopinionated wrapper of the native HTML5 validation. Will work with any CSS Framework and it's dead easy to be incorporated in your project as it works through the HTMLElement attributes. Do all your work in the html markup and let the Formally do the weird javascript functionality for you. For most cases `zero`, 0, `nada` lines of javascript are required!
